## Usage

### Default Profiles

The mod comes with two pre-configured profiles:

1. **All Items (Default)** - `Shift + X`
   - Highlights all items and containers within 1500 units
   - Hold mode (labels disappear when key is released)

2. **NPCs & Creatures** - `Shift + P`
   - Highlights NPCs and creatures within 300 units
   - Toggle mode (press once to show, press again to hide)

### Configuring Profiles

1. Open the game menu (Esc)
2. Go to Settings ‚Üí Mods ‚Üí Twenty Twenty Objects
3. Select a profile to edit or click "Add" to create a new one
4. Configure:
   - **Name**: Display name for the profile
   - **Hotkey**: Click "Change" and press your desired key combination
   - **Mode**: Toggle between hold-to-show and toggle mode
   - **Radius**: Detection range in game units
   - **Filters**: Select which object types to highlight

### Understanding the Display

When you activate highlighting:
- **Labels appear in Morrowind's native tooltip style** - dark background with yellowish text
- **Thin lines connect labels to objects** when labels need to move to avoid overlap
- **Important objects (NPCs) get priority** for the best label positions
- **Every object gets its own label** - no confusing "5 items" groups

The system intelligently spreads labels out so they don't overlap, while maintaining clear visual connections to their objects.

### Performance Settings

The **Performance** tab offers:
- Quick presets: Potato, Balanced, or Ultra
- Max labels limit (5-50)
- Occlusion quality (hide labels behind walls)
- Update rate control

### Tips

- **Can't see what a label points to?** Follow the thin connecting line to the object
- **Too many labels?** Reduce your detection radius or filter object types
- **Performance issues?** Use the "Potato" preset or disable occlusion checking
- **Finding specific items?** Create custom profiles for different scenarios
- **Dense loot pile?** Labels automatically spread out with lines showing what's what
- Labels automatically hide when objects are behind walls (with occlusion enabled)

## Performance

This mod is designed with performance in mind:

- No background processing when highlights are inactive
- Efficient spatial queries using OpenMW's built-in nearby object lists
- Smart culling of off-screen labels
- Optimized update intervals for smooth label tracking

### Performance Tips

- Keep radius values reasonable (under 2000 for dense areas)
- Disable unnecessary object type filters
- Use hold mode instead of toggle mode when doing quick scans
- Consider your view distance settings when setting large radius values

## Troubleshooting

### Labels not appearing
- Ensure the mod is properly enabled in the launcher
- Check that your hotkey isn't conflicting with other mods or game controls
- Verify objects are within the configured radius
- Make sure the appropriate filters are enabled

### Performance issues
- Reduce the radius value
- Limit the number of active filters
- Check if other script-heavy mods are running
- Ensure object paging settings are reasonable

### Hotkey conflicts
- The mod will detect if a hotkey is already used by another profile
- Choose modifier combinations (Shift/Ctrl/Alt) to avoid conflicts
- Common game keys to avoid: E (activate), R (ready), Space (jump)

## Compatibility

This mod is fully compatible with:
- All content expansions (Tamriel Rebuilt, SHOTN, etc.)
- Other UI mods
- Graphics replacers
- Most gameplay mods

No known incompatibilities.
